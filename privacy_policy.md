# Privacy Policy

## 1. Data Collection
Our bot collects the following data to provide its features:
- **User IDs**: Used to manage virtual currency, gambling activities, and user profiles (e.g., economy commands like `cash`, `daily`, `leaderboard`, and profile commands like `marry`, `level`).
- **Server IDs**: Used to provide music functionality (e.g., `play`, `queue`, `skip`) and ensure proper operation of server-specific features.
- **Message Content**: Used to process commands related to economy (`buy`, `rob`, `trade`), gambling (`blackjack`, `coinflip`, `slots`), music (`lyric`, `volume`), and general actions (`help`, `ping`, `userinfo`).

## 2. Data Usage
The collected data is used solely for:
- Executing bot commands across various modules:
  - **Economy**: Managing virtual currency, transactions, and activities (`cash`, `deposit`, `lottery`, `work`, etc.).
  - **Gambling**: Facilitating games like `blackjack`, `coinflip`, `dice`, and `slots`.
  - **Music**: Playing, queuing, and controlling music playback (`play`, `skip`, `volume`, etc.).
  - **Profile**: Customizing user profiles (`description`, `background`, `marry`, `profile`).
  - **Actions**: Enabling fun interactions like `hug`, `kiss`, `slap`, and `wink`.
  - **General**: Providing utility commands like `botinfo`, `invite`, `math`, and `serverbanner`.
- Ensuring proper functionality of the bot within your server.

## 3. Data Storage
- All data is stored securely and is not shared with third parties.
- No sensitive personal information (e.g., real names, email addresses) is stored outside of Discord.
- Temporary caching of message content may occur to process commands but is not retained long-term.

## 4. Data Protection
We take reasonable measures to protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse. This includes:
- Using secure connections (HTTPS) for data transmission.
- Limiting access to stored data to authorized bot developers only.

## 5. Opt-Out
Users can stop interacting with the bot at any time. If you wish to delete your stored data (e.g., economy balances, profile information), contact the bot owner via Discord using the information provided below.

## 6. Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in bot functionality or legal requirements. Users will be notified of significant changes through announcements or updates in the botâ€™s support server.
